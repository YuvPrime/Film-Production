<p>Gautham Menon says <strong>Yennai Arindhaal </strong>is by far Ajith&#8217;s best work. Gautham adds there are many applause-worthy moments in the film. &#8220;In <i>Arrambam</i>, there is a moment when he looks sharply at someone touching his shoulder. I have loved some of the moments from his earlier films. These are there but the audience will forget they are watching an Ajith film 15 minutes into it,&#8221; <a title="Gautham Menon" href="http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/interview-with-gautham-vasudev-menon/article6852727.ece?secpage=true&amp;secname=entertainment" target="_blank"><strong>says Gautham Menon</strong></a>.</p> <p>&#8220;I have made a couple of bold moves in this film, which is in the modern space. Even though we haven’t shown anything happening and it has been left to the audience’s imagination,&#8221; adds Gautham.</p> <p><strong>Yennai Arindhaal </strong> is slated for worldwide release tomorrow and the world&#8217;s first premiere is scheduled to happen tonight in Dubai at 12 AM IST.</p> <p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.onlykollywood.com/yennai-arindhaal-is-by-far-ajiths-best-work-gautham-menon/">Yennai Arindhaal is by far Ajith&#8217;s best work: Gautham Menon</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.onlykollywood.com">Only Kollywood</a>.</p>

Varalaxmi has apparently broken her collar bone and later she realized it got dislocated when she underwent medical treatment. But, she has never revealed this to Bala and continued her work.</p> <p>After becoming aware of the accident, Bala was moved to tears and gifted Varu an expensive gold chain which he was wearing on the spot. The team is currently shooting in Thanjavur and Ilaiyaraja is visiting the sets today. Bala and team are planning a grand reception for the Maestro.</p> <p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.onlykollywood.com/varalaxmi-sarathkumars-unintimidated-commitment-moves-bala/">Varalaxmi Sarathkumar&#8217;s unintimidated commitment moves Bala</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.onlykollywood.com">Only Kollywood</a>.</p>
