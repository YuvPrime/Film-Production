<p>Gautham Menon says <strong>Yennai Arindhaal </strong>is by far Ajith&#8217;s best work. Gautham adds there are many applause-worthy moments in the film. &#8220;In <i>Arrambam</i>, there is a moment when he looks sharply at someone touching his shoulder. I have loved some of the moments from his earlier films. These are there but the audience will forget they are watching an Ajith film 15 minutes into it,&#8221; <a title="Gautham Menon" href="http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/interview-with-gautham-vasudev-menon/article6852727.ece?secpage=true&amp;secname=entertainment" target="_blank"><strong>says Gautham Menon</strong></a>.</p> <p>&#8220;I have made a couple of bold moves in this film, which is in the modern space. Even though we haven’t shown anything happening and it has been left to the audience’s imagination,&#8221; adds Gautham.</p> <p><strong>Yennai Arindhaal </strong> is slated for worldwide release tomorrow and the world&#8217;s first premiere is scheduled to happen tonight in Dubai at 12 AM IST.</p> <p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.onlykollywood.com/yennai-arindhaal-is-by-far-ajiths-best-work-gautham-menon/">Yennai Arindhaal is by far Ajith&#8217;s best work: Gautham Menon</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.onlykollywood.com">Only Kollywood</a>.</p>
